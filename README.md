# EyeZ
This repository is no longer actively maintained. The code available here is consistent with what was used for the experiments described in the paper "A Comprehensive Investigation into Sclera Biometrics: A Novel Dataset and Performance Study". The new updated version of the repository is currently in development and will be available [here](https://github.com/MatejVitek/EyeZ) once complete.
